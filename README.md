## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor 

### What I learned

As I used SASS to compile my final CSS, I improve my knowledge about nesting classes in SASS. In the past I had trouble with this :innocent: 

### Useful resources

- [SASS Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) - It has been a while since the last time I used SASS so I need it a little help. Yes, this project was made on SASS but the .scss file it's not going to GitHub :rofl:
